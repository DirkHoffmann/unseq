# UNSEQ - revert a sequence (of numbers) to rules

A simple Unix tool to describe a list of numbers (which is too long for visual inspection), like the output of one more more `seq` commands, by a set of rules, similar to what the `seq` commands would take to regenerate the same list.

Documentation to be completed (as of November 2023).

The option `SEP=""` generates a compact output format (without spaces).

## Usage

The `make tests` command yields an illustrative list of examples for usage.
